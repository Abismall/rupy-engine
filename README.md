## Next Steps

### Enable 3D Rendering

- **Define 3D Objects**: Create and load vertex data for 3D models (positions, normals, and texture coordinates).

- **Set Up Camera and Projections**: Implement camera controls and projection matrices to view 3D space.

- **Enhance Shaders**: Expand the shaders to include lighting, shading, and any other 3D-specific calculations.

- **Bind Buffers and Textures**: Manage vertex, index, and uniform buffers and bind any necessary textures.

- **Draw Calls**: Implement drawing logic.
